# debezium-sql-change-stream
SQL Server Change Stream sample using Debezium


## (Optional) Restore World Wide Importers sample database

If you want to try Debezium on a sample database instead of a database you already have, you can download the World Wide Importers sample database from here:

https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/tag/wide-world-importers-v1.0

Make sure you download the OLTP database if you want to follow this guide without having to change a thing.
